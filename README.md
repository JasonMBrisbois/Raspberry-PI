# Raspberry-PI
Hardware integration section of Capstone Project Spicy Car

This is one of the components of my team capstone project.  This program will be on the hardware (a raspberry pi), updating the hardware with any updates from the app.  It will also be updating itself and sending the new infomation to the app if the user alters the car from the hardware's side.
